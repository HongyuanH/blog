## Linear Block Code
A very simple linear block code can be represented with a **Generator Matrix** `G`, for example:

![1_GMatrix.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/1_GMatrix.png#middle)

If `c` is the uncoded bits:

![2_cVector.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/2_cVector.png#middle)

The encoded bits `d` can be obtained via matrix `G`:

![3_dVector.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/3_dVector.png#middle)

`H` is defined as the **Parity Matrix**, where:
![4_GEquation.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/4_GEquation.png#middle)
![5_HEquation.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/5_HEquation.png#middle)

In this example, `H` is:

![6_HMatrix.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/6_HMatrix.png#middle)

where each row represents one of the there parity check equations below:

![6_Hparity.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/6_Hparity.png#middle)


## LDPC
LDPC code is simply one kind of linear block code where the dimension of `H` is big (e.g. 1944\*972) but the percentage of **1**'s in the **Parity Matrix** is very low (e.g. only 8 **1**'s per row in the matrix, resulting a percentage of 8/1944).


## Graphic Representation (Tanner Graph) of LDPC
The **Parity Matrix** of LDPC can be described with a graph of Check Nodes(CN) and Variable Nodes(VN). Each CN represents a parity bit in the matrix and each VN represents one bit of the codeword. CN<sub>i</sub> is connected to VN<sub>j</sub> if the element h<sub>ij</sub> of `H` is a 1. Below is the Tanner Graph of the `H` matrix in this example:

![7_TannerGraph.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/7_TannerGraph.png#middle#middle)


## Message Passing Algorithm
The Message Passing algorithm is based on the Tanner Graph.

Step 1: VN uses the received LLR as the message and pass them to the CN

![8_MsgPassing1.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/8_MsgPassing1.png#middle#middle)

Step 2: CN calculate the new message and send them back to VN

![9_MsgPassing2.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/9_MsgPassing2.png#middle#middle)

Step 3: VN calculate the new LLR based on the received message from CN

Step 4: repeat Step 1 to Step 3 using the new LLR


## The Standard TPMP Decoding Algorithm[2]

The nature of LDPC decoding algorithms is mainly iterative. Most of these algorithms are derived from the well-known belief propagation (BP) algorithm [3]. The aim of BP algorithm is to compute the a posteriori probability (APP) that a given bit in the transmitted codeword c = [c<sub>0,</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, ... , c<sub>N−1</sub>] equals 1, given the received word y = [y<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, ... , y<sub>N−1</sub>]. For binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with mean 1 and variance σ<sup>2</sup>, the reliability messages represented as logarithmic likelihood ratio (LLR) are computed in two steps: (1) check node update and (2) variable node update. This is also referred to as twophase message passing (TPMP).

For n<sup>th</sup> iteration, let **α<sup>n</sup><sub>j</sub>** represents the LLR of **VN<sub>j</sub>**, **α<sup>n</sup><sub>i,j</sub>** represent the message sent from variable node **VN<sub>j</sub>** to check node **CN<sub>i</sub>**, **β<sup>n</sup><sub>i,j</sub>** represent the message sent from **CN<sub>i</sub>** to  **VN<sub>j</sub>**; **M(j) = {i : H<sub>ij</sub> = 1}** is the set of parity checks in which **VN<sub>j</sub>** participates, **N(i) = {j : H<sub>ij</sub> = 1}** the set of variable nodes that participate in parity check **i**, **M(j) \ i** the set **M(j)** with **CN<sub>i</sub>** excluded, and **N(i) \ j** the set N(i) with **VN<sub>j</sub>** excluded.

The standard TPMP algorithm is described as below:

![10_TPMP.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/10_TPMP.png#middle#middle)


For different decoding schemes, the calculation of **β<sup>n</sup><sub>i,j</sub>** is different. The **Sum Product (SP)** algorithm [4] gives near-optimal results; however, the implementation of the transcendental function Φ(x) requires dedicated LUTs, leading to significant hardware complexity [5]. **Min-Sum (MS)** algorithm [6] is a simple approximation of the **SP**: its easy implementation suffers an 0.2 dB performance loss compared to **SP** decoding [7]. **Normalized Min-Sum (NMS)** algorithm [8] gives better performance than **MS** by multiplying the **MS** check node update by a positive constant λ<sub>k</sub>, smaller than 1. **Offset Min-Sum (OMS)** is another improvement of standard **MS** algorithm which reduces the reliability values **β<sup>n</sup><sub>i,j</sub>** by a positive value **β**. All the four schemes are summarised in the below table:

![11_UpdateTable.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/11_UpdateTable.png#middle#middle)



## Layered Decoding Algorithm[2]
Modify the VN update rule as:

![12_VNUpdateRule.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/12_VNUpdateRule.png#middle#middle)

Then step(2)(3)(4) in TPMP can be merged into one operation. This technique is called layered decoding which considers the matrix `H` as a concatenation of layers of constituent sub-matrices, where the dimension of each sub-matrices is 1 \* M. The layered decoding algorithm is described as below (**NMS** is used here with normalisation factor λ):

![13_Layered.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/13_Layered.png#middle#middle)



## QC-LDPC and Parallelism in Layered Decoding Algorithm[9]
Quasi-Cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes have been widely used in many practical systems, such as IEEE 802.11n WLAN, IEEE 802.16e WiMAX, also in Verizon 5G. The parity check matrix for a QC-LDPC code can be represented as an array of square sub-matrices, where each sub-matrix is either a Z \* Z zero matrix or a Z \* Z circulant matrix. As an example, Below shows the parity check matrix for the block length 1944 bits, code rate 1/2, sub-matrix size Z = 81 LDPC code. In this matrix representation, each square box with a label I<sub>x</sub> represents an 81 \* 81 cyclicly-shifted identity matrix with a shifted value of x, and each empty box represents an 81 \* 81 zero matrix.

![14_QCH.png]({{ site.github.url }}/res/2017-08-30-LDPC/14_QCH.png#middle#middle)

One advantage of QC-LDPC code is allowing parallelization of the layered decoding algorithm. Because each square sub-matrices is either a zero matrix or a circulant matrix, all the Z layers within a square sub-matrices can be processed simultaneously.
